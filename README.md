## Project Overview
Analyzing a linked list problem

### Project Tasks

#####   The project language is Python
For a given linked list containing the first 100 numbers of the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...,218922995834555200000, provide a solution that returns a linked list in the following order: 218922995834555200000, ..., 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0. Please do not rely on standard packages for queues.

## Project Implementation

## Running the project
1. Run the make setup file in the Makefile for environment setu and cd into the environment:  `make setup`
2. Run the make install file to install all requirements in the requirements.txt and update or install the python:  `make install`
3. Run the make install file to install all requirements in the requirements.txt and update or install the python--Note that it should not be run orlese you wannna experiment with the structure  `gRPCSetUp:`
4. Standalone lastly, both should be run on two different CLI:  `python server.py`, `python client.py` and should run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
5. Delete Everything:  `./delete.sh`
