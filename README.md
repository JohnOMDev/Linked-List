## Project Overview
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

### Project Tasks

#####   The project language is Python
For a given linked list containing the first 100 numbers of the sequence: 
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...,218922995834555200000, provide a solution that returns a linked list in the following order: 
218922995834555200000, ..., 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0. 
Please do not rely on standard packages for queues.
